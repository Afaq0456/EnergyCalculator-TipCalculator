## Tip Calculator (Using Constructor and Object)

**Description:**
The Tip Calculator program calculates the gratuity and total bill amount for a financial application. It prompts the user to enter the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity based on the provided percentage. The total bill amount is calculated by adding the gratuity to the subtotal. The program demonstrates the use of a constructor and an object-oriented approach to solve the problem.

**File:** `TipCalculatorObject.java`

**How to Run:**
1. Compile the Java program: `javac TipCalculatorObject.java`
2. Run the program: `java TipCalculatorObject`

## Sum of Digits (Using Constructor and Object)

**Description:**
The Sum of Digits program calculates the sum of the digits of a user-entered integer between 0 and 1000. It uses a class with a constructor and an object to manage the data and perform the calculations. The program extracts individual digits from the input number and adds them together to find the sum. Additionally, it determines whether the sum is even or odd and provides the result to the user.

**File:** `SumOfDigitsUsingObject.java`

**How to Run:**
1. Compile the Java program: `javac SumOfDigitsUsingObject.java`
2. Run the program: `java SumOfDigitsUsingObject`

## Energy Calculator (Using Constructor and Object)

**Description:**
The Energy Calculator program calculates the energy required to heat a given amount of water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. The user is prompted to input the water weight in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures in degrees Celsius. The program uses a class with a constructor and an object to manage the data and perform the energy calculation based on a predefined formula. The result, measured in joules, is displayed to the user.

**File:** `EnergyCalculatorObject.java`

**How to Run:**
1. Compile the Java program: `javac EnergyCalculatorObject.java`
2. Run the program: `java EnergyCalculatorObject`

These Java programs are meant to serve as educational examples and practical solutions for various tasks. Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about Java programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

Enjoy coding!
